Simple RSA

Hint : Use FactorDB, cannot manually figure out the primes p and q.

gcd(e,phi)=1 ?? why --> ans it.

The message is a palindromic number starts and ends with 9. Use solve script !!

# Type of attack - ??
# Message (Integer number) - ??
# p=??
# q=??
# d=??
# phi=?? --> What is phi called ?? --> ans it.
